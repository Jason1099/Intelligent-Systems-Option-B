Task 1: Image Preprocessing

- Reads Image using OpenCV
- Converts Image to Grayscale using cv2.cvtColor
- Returns the processed Image

Task 2: Image Segmentation (Still in progress, currently in beta stage)

The isolating of individual digits is currently buggy. Digit extraction works but the extracted image are not the expected results. 
This may be a result of incorrect cropping or wrong centering/wrong alignment on boxes.
What we have currently implemented is, 

- Used otsu binarization and connected components
- Filtered the components based on the area and aspect ratio
- Cropped the extracted images with padding, having them centered and resizing
